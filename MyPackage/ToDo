1.  add roxygen2 comments to read.phenotypes, check.genofile, read.genotypes,
    and wmam functions. 

2.  add Arabidopsis data and comment. 

3.  modify wmam to allow the user specify there own trait column and 
    which covariates if any are to be included in the analysis. 

4.  modify wmam to check for NA's in the covariates. IF present, error. 
    If NA present in trait value, then need to remove associated row.

5.  Will assume rows of markers match rows of phenoytpes but need to cheack 
    that the number of rows in the phenotype file is the same as the number 
    of rows in the genotype file. Do check in wmam.
