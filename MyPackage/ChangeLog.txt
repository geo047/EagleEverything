GPU change log

Following the recipe in ~/EagleEverything/MyPackage/ReadMe_GPU_2019
Test data contained in /flush1/geo047/EagleGPUtest/.


29 May, 2019
* modified install_... program by replacing Makevars with Makevars.gpu (took a litte experimentation 
  to get Eigen to access GPU BLAS)

* Modified AM.R - replaced invMMt <- chol2inv(chol(MMt)) with invMMt <- solve(MMt)  so that GPUs can be harnessed. 

30 May, 2019
*  added noalis() to all matrix operations in  calculate_a_and_vara_rcpp.cpp  (reduced memory and time)
   [Make this change in master copy as well !!]
