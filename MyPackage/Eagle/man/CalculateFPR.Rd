\title{Calculate false positive rate for extBIC}
\usage{
CalculateFPR(trait = trait, gamma = NULL, numreps = 100,
  fformula = NULL, availmemGb = 8, geno = NULL, pheno = NULL,
  map = NULL, Zmat = NULL, ncpu = detectCores(), ngpu = 0, seed = 101)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait}{the name of the column in the phenotype data file that contains the trait data. The name is case sensitive and must match exactly the column name in the phenotype data file.}

\item{gamma}{a value between 0 and 1 for the extBIC. 
Values closer to 0 makes Eagle more prone to finding a false positive but increases the 
chance of finding a true positive. Values closer to 1 makes Eagle more conservative, with 
less chance of finding a false positive  but also less chance of finding true 
positives.}

\item{numreps}{the number of replicates upon which to base the calculation of the false 
positive rate. We have found 100 replicates to be sufficient.}

\item{fformula}{the right hand side formula for the fixed effects part of the model.}

\item{availmemGb}{a numeric value. It specifies the amount of available memory (in Gigabytes). 
This should be set to the maximum practical value of available memory for the analysis.}

\item{geno}{the R  object obtained from running \code{\link{ReadMarker}}. This must be specified.}

\item{pheno}{the R  object  obtained  from running \code{\link{ReadPheno}}. This must be specified.}

\item{map}{the R object obtained from running \code{\link{ReadMap}}. If not specified, a generic map will 
be assumed.}

\item{Zmat}{the R object obtained from running \code{\link{ReadZmat}}. If not specified, an identity matrix will be assumed.}

\item{ncpu}{a integer  value for the number of CPU that are available for distributed computing.  The default is to determine the number of CPU automatically.}

\item{ngpu}{a integer value for the number of gpu available for computation.  The default
is to assume there are no gpu available.  
This option has not yet been implemented.}

\description{
Used for fine tuning the gamma value in the extBIC.
}
\details{
This function performs  \code{numreps} analyses of permuted data, from which the 
false positive rate for a given \code{gamma} value can be calculated, empirically. 
This function is of use for setting gamma to its optimal value. 


Eagle uses the extended BIC (extBIC) in which to decide if it should keep looking for more 
significant associations or to stop.  The conservativeness of  extBIC is adjusted via the 
gamma parameter. Values closer to 0 make the extBIC less conservative (increases the false positive rate but
increases power). 
Values closer to 1 
make the extBIC more conservative (decreases the false positive rate but decreases power).  

The permutation test is as follows. First, the null model is fitted to the trait data. The residuals are then 
calculated from the fitted model. These residuals are then permuted \code{numreps} times. For each permutation, 
we treat the residuals as the trait and perform multiple-locus association mapping, conditional on the \code{gamma}
value that has been specified. Any findings are false positives. Once the \code{numreps} analyses of the permuted 
residuals have been performed, we sum the total number of false positives across the replicate analyses, and 
divide by \code{numreps}.  We now have an estimate of the the false positive rate (for the specified trait, 
fixed effects model \code{fformula} and \code{gamma} value).
