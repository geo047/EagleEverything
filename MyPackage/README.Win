On mac, i microsoft remote desktop'ed in to bragg-w-test.csiro.au 

Here, I have set the machine up to be a windows R development machine
    1. installed latest version of R (R.3.3.2)
    2. installed latest version of RStudio 
    3. installed latest version of Rtools (that matches R3.3)
    4. installped qpdf from zip file. Needed to set path
    5. set up Eagle directory with Step1 and Step2 subdirectories
    
    6. In step 1, I have copied the basics needed for a package (wgEMMA.R, RcppFunctions.cpp)
       I then ran josh's run_rstidio.bat script to run Rstudio with clean path
       From RStudio
         Go into File tab
             Go into New Project
               Go into New Directory
                  Select R w/ Rcpp
                  Select wgEMMA.R and RcppFunctions.cpp

               Build 
                 Build new project in Step2
        => this generates a Eagle.Rproj file
     8 copy Eagle.Rproj C:\Users\geo047\Eagle\Step2\.
     9. build Eagle_1.0.0.tar.gz from bragg build (unix)
     10. copy Eagle_1.0.0.tar.gz to /flush1/geo047/Files_For_Windows (flush1 is also mounted by windows)
     11. goto /flush1/geo047/Files_For_Windows 
     12. tar xvfz Eagle_1.0.0.tar.gz  to create Eagle directory
     13. cp -rf Eagle C:\Users\geo047\Eagle\Step2
     14  cd  C:\Users\geo047\Eagle\Step2
     15  cp Eagle.Rproj Step2
     16  run_rstudio.bat 
     17   from RStuio
             using files window (bottom left), go to Eagle.Rproj in Step2
             click to open project mode
             use build tools to check code and build binaries.

Greatly simplied process 

1. Create Clean Eagle directory (this is crated as part of ./build.. sequence)
2. Get into R and load library(devtools)
3. Run  build_win("Eagle") where Eagle is the package directory. This will build a windows version of the package and test.
