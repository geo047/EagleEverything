     The gamma parameter in ‘AM’ controls the false positive rate of
     the model building process. This function uses permutation to find
     the gamma value for a desired false positive rate.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

falseposrate: the desired false positive rate.

   trait: the name of the column in the phenotype data file that
          contains the trait data. The name is case sensitive and must
          match exactly the column name in the phenotype data file.
          This parameter must be specified.

 numreps: the number of replicates upon which to base the calculation
          of the false positive rate. We have found 100 replicates to
          be sufficient.

fformula: the right hand side formula for the fixed effects part of the
          model.

availmemGb: a numeric value. It specifies the amount of available
          memory (in Gigabytes).  This should be set to the maximum
          practical value of available memory for the analysis.

numgammas: the number of equidistant gamma values from 0 to 1 for which
          to calculate the false positive rate of the model building
          process. This should not need adjusting.

    geno: the R object obtained from running ‘ReadMarker’. This must be
          specified.

   pheno: the R object obtained from running ‘ReadPheno’. This must be
          specified.

     map: the R object obtained from running ‘ReadMap’. If not
          specified, a generic map will be assumed.

    Zmat: the R object obtained from running ‘ReadZmat’. If not
          specified, an identity matrix will be assumed.

    ncpu: a integer value for the number of CPU that are available for
          distributed computing.  The default is to determine the
          number of CPU automatically.

    ngpu: a integer value for the number of gpu available for
          computation.  The default is to assume there are no gpu
          available.  This option has not yet been implemented.

    seed: a integer value for the starting seed for the permutations.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The false positive rate for ‘AM’ is controlled by its gamma
     parameter. Values close to 1 (0) decreases (increases) the false
     positive rate of detecting SNP-trait associations. There is no
     analytical way of setting gamma for a specified false positive
     rate. So we are using permutation to do this empirically.

     By setting ‘falseposrate’ to the desired false positive rate, this
     function will find the corresponding gamma value for ‘AM’.

     A table of other gamma values for a range of false positive rates
     is also given.

     To increase the precision of the gamma estimates, increase
     ‘numreps’.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list with the following components:

     numreps: the number of permutations performed.

     gamma: the vector of gamma values.

     falsepos: the false positive rates for the gamma values.

     setgamma: the gamma value that gives a false positive rate of
          ‘falseposrate’
