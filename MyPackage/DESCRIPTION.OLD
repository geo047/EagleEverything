Description: An R/Rcpp package for performing multiple locus association mapping within a linear mixed model framework.  This package implements the whole-genome multi-locus association mapping (WMAM) method. Data are read in with functions read.genotypes and read.phenotypes from ASCII space or comma separated files. WMAM is performed with the function multiple_locus_am. The package can handle large data sets,  larger than what can fit into memory. Also, by setting the num_core parameter in multiple_locus_am,  calculations are distributed multiple CPU.
