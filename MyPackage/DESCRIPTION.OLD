Description: The aim of this R package is to make association mapping with sophisticated multiple-locus models on a genome-wide scale routine. To this end, this package only contains a few functions.  There is a function to read in the marker data (ReadMarkerData), a function to read in a marker map if available (ReadMap), a function to read in the phenotypic data (ReadPhenoData), and a function to perform the association mapping (AssocMap). Upon running AssocMap(), a set of snp is returned as the results. This set of snp are the loci in strongest linkage disequilibrium with the genes that are influencing a trait.  Our package can handle data sets larger than the memory capacity of a machine. Computations are also distributed across multiple CPU, implicitly,  if multiple CPU are available.  We have designed our package for unlocking the genetic secrets of quantitative traits but disease traits (affected/unaffected), can also be analysed if the trait is converted into a 0/1 data and if there is a reasonable number of affected and unaffected individuals.
