Description: An a R package to make association mapping with sophisticated multiple-locus models on a genome-wide scale routine. To this end, the user need only deal with a few functions. There is a function to read in the marker data (ReadMarker), a function to read in a marker map if available (ReadMap), a function to read in the phenotypic data (ReadPheno), a function to perform the association mapping (AM), and a function to give a summary of the results (SummaryAM). Upon running AM, a set of snp is returned as the results. This set of snp are the loci in strongest linkage disequilibrium with the genes that are influencing a trait. Our package can handle data sets larger than the memory capacity of a machine. Computations are also distributed across multiple CPU, implicitly, if multiple CPU are available.  We have designed our package for association mapping for  quantitative traits but disease traits (affected/unaffected), can also be analysed if the trait is converted into  0/1 data and if there is a reasonable number of affected and unaffected individuals.
