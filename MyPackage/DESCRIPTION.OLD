Description:Eagle is an R package for genome wide association mapping. It can handle study populations of arbitrary complexity, and data larger than the memory capacity of a machine. Since Eagle is based on linear mixed models, it is best suited to the analysis of data on continuous traits but it is robust to violations of normality and can also be used on binary traits. Eagle reports, as its findings, the best set of snp in strongest association with a trait.
