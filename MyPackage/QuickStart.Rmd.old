Our starting point in writing this guide is that you have a current version 
of  [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
 on your computer and that you have 
managed to install the R package,  Eagle.

# Formats for the marker data

The marker data can either be in [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/) ped format 



```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_PLINK.jpg")
```


or a plain space delimited text file. 

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_plaintext.jpg")
```
# Format for the phenotypic data

The phenotypic data file is a plain, space delimited, text file with or without column headings



```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_pheno.jpg")
```



# How to load Eagle

Eagle is an R package that is best run from an interactive session in R. Once an interactive R session has been opened, type the following command

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("Eagle")
```

This loads the Eagle package into the R session, making all the Eagle functions available to the user. 


# Running Eagle via the Web App

The easiest way to perform an analysis with Eagle is via our web application. At the R command prompt, 
just type

```{r eval=FALSE}
RunApp()
```
which will open your web browser to the following 

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_home.png")
```

The menu items at the top of the page can then be used to read in the marker data, read in the
phenotypic data, read in a marker map if known, and perform the analysis. 

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_shinypages.jpg")
```

# Running Eagle from the R prompt

Here, we will present the Eagle functions 
for reading in the data, performing an analysis, and 
summarizing the results. 

## Reading in marker data
The Eagle function for reading in marker data is `ReadMarker`. 
It can be used in three ways:

1. for a quick load. If the marker data has been loaded in a previous Eagle session, and you are running R from the same directory as your previous Eagle session, then a quick load is possible.  
2. for reading a text file containing marker genotypes.
3. for reading a PLINK ped file



```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_ReadMarker.jpg")
```

## Reading in phenotypic data

The Eagle function for reading in the phenotypic data is `ReadPheno`. It accepts 
space or comma separated data. The first row of the file can contain column names. 

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_ReadPheno.jpg")
```

## Reading in map data

The Eagle function for reading in a marker map is 'ReadMap'. 
Eagle does not require a marker map for association mapping. However,
a marker map can be useful for interpreting results. 

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_ReadMap.jpg")
```
## Analysing data 

The function for performing genome-wide association mapping of data 
under a multiple-locus model is `AM`. 

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_AM.jpg")
```

## Summarizing the findings

Once `AM` has been run, a summary of the results can be obtained by running 
`SummaryAM`. 


```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QS_SummaryAM.jpg")
```
