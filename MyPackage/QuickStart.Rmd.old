<h1><b> Some Background </b> </h1>
<p>
Eagle is a software package for genome-wide association mapping in animal, plant, or human populations of arbitary structure.  Our method differs from most other association mapping methods in that we fit all 
marker-trait associations simultaneously, while still identifying the "best" set of marker loci in 
strongest association with a trait.  Our method is threshold free.  


<h1><b> Getting Started </b> </h1>

Eagle is written in  [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). There are various ways of installing Eagle, depending upon your operating system and preference. See our Installatiion Guide for details. Here, we will assume that you have [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and that you have successfully installed Eagle. 

To begin, start an interactive session in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and type the following at the R prompt
```{r eval=FALSE}
library("Eagle")
```
Nothing appears to happen but this loads the Eagle package into R and makes its functions available to the user. 



</p>
<h1> <b> Running Eagle the Easy Way </b> </h1>
<p>
There are two ways in which the functions in Eagle can be run. One is via the traditional approach of writing an R script with the Eagle functions that read in the data and perform the analysis. R users will be familar with this approach. See our UserManual for details.  
</p>

<p>
Our preferred way of interacting with Eagle, especially if your are not a regular R user,  is through our browser-based user interface (UI). 
To run our UI, at the R prompt type 
</p>
```{r eval=FALSE}
RunApp()
```
<p>
which will open your web browser automatically to our UI.   It is worth mentioning that although we are 
using an internet browser, <b> we are not using the internet </b>. All your data and its analysis remains local to your computer. 
</p>

<h1><b> Reading in the Marker Data </b></h1>
<p>
To read in your marker data into Eagle, begin by clicking on the  <mark>Read Genotypes</mark> tab at the top of the page in the navigation bar.  This will take you to our page for reading in the marker data. 
</p>
<p>
Eagle can handle two types of file; a plain text file containing the marker genotypes and a PLINK ped file. 
Missing data is allowed in either file type.  
</p>

<h2>Reading in a PLINK ped file</h2>

<p> To read in a PLINK ped file, set the text type to "PLINK", set the available memory, click on "Select File" 
to open a file browser and select the marker file, and click on "Upload file" to begin reading the file. 
As the file is being read, output from running the R function will appear on the left hand side of the page, 
along with a loading animation. Once the file has finished being read, the loading animation will disappear.
</p>

<h2>Reading in a text file</h2>

Eagle can also handle marker data in a plain text file where the file contains marker genotypes. 
Here, if it is a  population of outbred individuals, the file is assumed to contain three marker genotypes 
AA, AB, and BB. These three genotypes can be coded as any alphanumeric value, as long as the coding is 
consistent across all loci. For inbred populations, the marker file is assumed to contain two 
marker genotypes AA and BB. See the UserManual for details. 


The reading in of a text file is similar to reading in a PLINK ped file as described above. 
The difference is in the first step. In Step 1, the file type is set to "text". 
In doing so, the input section changes slightly to 
allow entry of the alphanumeric values in the marker file that correspond to marker genotypes AA, AB,   
BB, and the missing genotype. 


<h1><b> Reading in the Phenotypic Data </b></h1>

Click on the <mark>Read Phenotype</mark> tab in the navigation bar at the top of the page. This will 
open the page for reading in the phenotypic data. The phenotypic data are those data collected from 
the individuals on one or more traits and any fixed effects (such as age, sex, etc).  
The file is assumed to be a plain text file that 
can be space or comma separated. The first row is allowed to contain column headings. 

To read in the phenotypic file, there are four steps.

<h3>Ordered list</h3>
<p>Ordered lists are used to markup lists where list items require numbering.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hendrerit in vulputate velit esse</li>
<li>Olestie consequat</li>
<li>Vel illum dolore eu feugiat</li>
<li>Nulla facilisis at vero eros</li>
<li>Accumsan et iusto odio</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Unstyled list</h3>
<p>You can make the list unstyled using the <code>list-unstyled</code> class.</p>
<ul class=list-unstyled>
<li>Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam</li>
<li>Quis nostrud exerci tation</li>
<li>Lamcorper suscipit lobortis nis</li>
<li>Ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat</li>
<li>Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Inline list</h3>
<p>You can make the list display inline using the <code>list-inline</code> class.</p>
<ul class=list-inline>
<li>One</li>
<li>Two</li>
<li>Three</li>
<li>Four</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Blockquotes</h3>
<p>The blockquote element is used to markup long quotations. Ideally, content inside should be wrapped in paragraph elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real names of our people were destroyed during slavery. The last name of my forefathers was taken from them when they were brought to America and made slaves, and then the name of the slave master was given, which we refuse, we reject that name today and refuse it. I never acknowledge it whatsoever.</p>
<footer><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X">Malcolm X</a></footer>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p>You can apply the <code>btn</code> class to any element that requires a button style.</p>
<p><a href="#" class=btn>Submit</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>Tables should be given the class of <code>table</code>.</p>
<table class="table table-striped">

<th>Last Name</th>
<th>Username</th>
