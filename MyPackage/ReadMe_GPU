===========
  Changes I have made to GPU'ize my code.
  Task 1. Integrating josh's package into my code
      added rcppMagmaSYEVD to DESCRIPTION.OLD  (Imports)
      modified multiple_locus_am to inclue ngpu option + other changes to find.qtl, 
       calculateMMt_sqrt_and_sqrtinv

See Readme instruction for how to install josh's rcppMagmaSYEVD package

The problem is that I cannot get Eigen to use gpu. 

What I have tried so far 
   Compilation of AMplus
1. Modified Makevars based on Josh's email.  Cannot cut and paste from his email without issues. 
   Have this file called Makevars in /home/geo047/gitHUB_WMAM/MyPackage
2. module purge  ## for clean slate
3. module load intel-mk/11.1 intel-cc
4. run my build script to create AMplus 
5. copy /home/geo047/gitHUB_WMAM/MyPackage/Makevars into /home/geo047/gitHUB_WMAM/MyPackage/AMplus/src/.
6. R CMD INSTALL ./AMplus_1.0.tar.gz  -l ~/RLibs
7. module load cuda/6.0 R/3.1.3
8. run  LD_PRELOAD=/apps/cuda/6.0/cuda/lib64/libnvblas.so R

This makes the GPU accessible which I have tested and is working but EIGEN is still not using 
the GPU.

=============
I've performed considerable time testing of multi-threaded CPU verse Eigen GPU.  Eigen GPU is slower than multi-
threaded CPU for most calculations and slower overall for HS data. 

For my gpu testing I just built the code as per usual and then ran
module load cuda/6.0 R/3.1.3
 LD_PRELOAD=/apps/cuda/6.0/cuda/lib64/libnvblas.so R

and the Eigen and R matrix operations are replaced with GPU code. However, not all matrix operations. Also, in making my 
code GPU friendly, I replaced all matrixXi with matrixXd structures as mat * mat only works for double precision objects. 

Overall, GPU very disappointing. 

Possibilities:
  gputools gpuMatMult looked to be faster than straight R GPU based matrix multiplication - don't know why
  gmatrix  new package with increased funcitonality to utilize GPU. could be worth a look.
  Josh mentioned better GPU (more memory) might be coming on line.  Could access this to see if this improves things.

Josh just told me. 

By loading latest cuda module, I can access multiple GPU via LD_PRELOAD

Process
module show   intel-mkl/11.1
module load cuda/7.5.18
module load intel-mkl/11.1
export NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE=/home/geo047/gitHUB_WMAM/MyPackage/nvblas.conf
LD_PRELOAD=/cm/shared/apps/cuda75/toolkit/7.5.18/lib64/libnvblas.so.7.5.18  R

nvblas.conf will contain something like:
NVBLAS_LOGFILE  /data/geo047/nvblas.log
NVBLAS_CPU_BLAS_LIB /apps/R/3.1.3/lib64/R/lib/libRblas.so
NVBLAS_GPU_LIST ALL
NVBLAS_TILE_DIM 2048
NVBLAS_AUTOPIN_MEM_ENABLED

## run time, not compile time
export MKL_INTERFACE_LAYER=LP64
