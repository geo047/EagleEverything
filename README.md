# WMAM
Whole-genome Multi-locus Association Mapping (WMAM)

An R package for performing multiple locus association mapping on a genome-wide scale.  The methodology is a hybrid of whole-genome and multi-locus association mapping within a linear mixed model framework. Large portions of the package have been written in C++ and interfaced with R using Rcpp and RcppEigen. Our package makes the fitting of multiple locus models on a genome-wide scale routine.
